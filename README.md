# GridOpt.jl

Welcome to **GridOpt.jl**!

This repository is a collection of models and tools for **power system operation and planning**, implemented in the Julia programming language. The aim is to provide a flexible and efficient framework for optimizing various aspects of power grids, including:

- **Operational Planning**: Models for unit commitment, economic dispatch, and real-time grid management.
- **Long-term Planning**: Models for generation and transmission expansion, storage sizing, and resource adequacy analysis.

## Why GridOpt.jl?

Power systems are increasingly complex, with the need for efficient and reliable optimization methods. Juliaâ€™s high-performance capabilities make it an ideal language for tackling the challenges in power system optimization, allowing for fast prototyping and execution.

## Key Features

- **Ease of Use**: A user-friendly interface for defining power system models and running optimizations.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale problems, suitable for both academic research and practical applications.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable for different optimization scenarios, from short-term operations to long-term planning.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project, so bear with me as I continue to improve and expand the repository!
